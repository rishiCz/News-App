Hello,
This is a news app that just shows news..... and a little more than that.

- It has the ability to search for news like any other app BUT here you can create you own custom news template button to quicky search for that news.
- Also here you can bokkmark a news and save to offline saved section (local storage) of the app to maybe read later.
- This also provides you the basic functions to Go to the news website or share the news.

The UI of the app is focused towards the ease of use and is given a minimalistic appeal to the sophisticated design.
